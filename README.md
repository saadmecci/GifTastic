# GifTastic

A web application I created while in the Fullstack Bootcamp at UT.

It uses bootstrap and css for the styling, jQuery and javascript for the logic.

It uses the Giphy API to search for and display gifs on html page.

Initial Gif that appears will be a still image. 

Gif will animate when the user clicks on the image.

I went with a theme of music artists but the user can search for any topic they want that is available on giphy.
